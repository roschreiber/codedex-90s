## ðŸ’» CodÃ©dex in the 90s

This is my submission for the [CodÃ©dex Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/holiday-hackathon) which lasted **48h**.<br />
I chose Track 1, "Dot Com Boom" for my submission which tasked me to re-create an already existing website in the style of the 90s.<br />

I was **heavily** inspired by **Geocities** Websites for this project, which are known to be plastered with GIFs.<br />
**â†’** Luckily, the Internet Archive archived as many GIFs from Geocities as possible before it's shutdown, which allowed me to use them.
(see [Gifcities](https://gifcities.org/))<br/>

The Website is built using the **Astro** Framework, it's my first time using it, so any type of feedback on things like code structure, component use & more would be heavily appreciated. The Site is deployed & hosted on **Github Pages**.
